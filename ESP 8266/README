ESP8266 – Operation Trinetra: AirShield
Wi-Fi Capture & Threat Detection Module
📌 Role of ESP8266

The ESP8266 is the frontline security sensor in AirShield.
It acts as the primary Wi-Fi capture and monitoring unit, responsible for detecting suspicious network activity before it reaches the defense network.

Its responsibilities include:

Capturing Wi-Fi signals & packets using its onboard Wi-Fi radio + external Atheros AR9271 adapter

Monitoring packet frequency and patterns

Detecting unauthorized access attempts and scanning/probing attacks

Performing preliminary analytics on packets before forwarding to Arduino Uno

⚙️ Features

✔️ Continuous Wi-Fi packet sniffing
✔️ Works with Atheros AR9271 Wi-Fi Adapter for extended monitoring range
✔️ Detects:

Probe requests

Unauthorized associations

Packet flooding attacks
✔️ Extracts attacker IP, MAC, and packet metadata
✔️ Forwards structured alerts to Arduino Uno for filtering

🔄 Data Flow

ESP8266 + AR9271 scans nearby Wi-Fi traffic

Detects suspicious activity (e.g., scanning, spoofing attempts)

Extracts packet info: IP, MAC, signal strength, event type

Sends data via UART to Arduino Uno

Arduino applies filtering → Raspberry Pi Pico stores permanent logs
