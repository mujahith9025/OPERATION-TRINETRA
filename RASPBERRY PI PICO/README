Raspberry Pi Pico – Operation Trinetra: AirShield
Logging & Permanent Storage Layer for Real-Time Wireless Security
📌 Role of Raspberry Pi Pico

The Raspberry Pi Pico acts as the data logger and storage controller in the AirShield system.

Its main responsibilities include:

Receiving filtered data from the Arduino Uno

Maintaining permanent logs of attacker details on an SD card

Storing:

Attacker IP Address

MAC Address

Reason for Blocking

Timestamp of detection

Ensuring logs are tamper-proof and permanent for later forensic analysis

⚙️ Features

✔️ SD card-based permanent record-keeping
✔️ Lightweight but structured log storage (CSV/JSON format)
✔️ Real-time logging of threats detected by ESP8266 + Arduino Uno
✔️ Timestamping for forensic accuracy
✔️ Buffer mechanism for continuous packet flow

🔄 Data Flow

ESP8266 captures suspicious activity and forwards it to Arduino Uno

Arduino Uno filters and tags data (valid/suspicious/blocked)

Raspberry Pi Pico receives filtered data via serial interface

Logs detailed attacker information into the SD card

Data is later accessed by the Web Dashboard for visualization
